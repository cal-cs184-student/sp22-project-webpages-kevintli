			<h1>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles (20 pts)</h1>
			<p>Our strategy is reminiscent of rejection sampling. To rasterize a triangle, 
				Derive a min_x, max_x, min_y, and max_y from the coordinates of the triangle’s vertices. If any of these values exceed the bounds of the frame buffer (e.g., max_x greater than the frame buffer’s width), clamp the point to the edge of the frame buffer (e.g., max_x becomes the framebuffer’s width). 
				For each pixel in our bounding box, perform the point-in-triangle test, outlined in steps 3a - 3c. Sample the center of each pixel (i.e., x + ½, y + ½).
				Point-in-triangle test: For each edge of the triangle,
				Arrange the edge’s start and endpoints in counterclockwise orientation.
				Perform the line test as described in the lecture to determine if the point is on or inside the edge.
				If all three edges pass our line test, the point must be inside the triangle.  
				If a point passes the point-in-triangle test, fill the pixel with the inputted color value. Otherwise, reject the point (i.e., do nothing).
